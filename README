Task 1: timer

To calculate execution time I used the fork-exec-wait cycle but I got called the gettimeofday twice. Once when child is executing and once when the parent had finished executing. I then found the difference between the two using the provided function.

Task 2: mini-sh

The main thing to understanding this part was understanding how tok works, this part is simply and extension of timer. I just stored whatever tok return to the array. I then used the array similer to how the argv array was used in the timer.c.
